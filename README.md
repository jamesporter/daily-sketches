# Daily Sketches

Create algorithmic art everyday.

`gatsby develop` to start coding

`yarn gen` to generate a new sketch for today (or the next day you haven't done one for).

[Sample deploy](https://daily-sketches.netlify.com)

Customise the config in package.json, especially the dsConfig stuff. The styling is intentionally basic, you probably will want to customise.

**NB Don't edit files in pages directory as these get generated.** Instead customise the generated code in `generate.ts`
